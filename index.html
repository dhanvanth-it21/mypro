    <h2>Reviews</h2>
    <p>The HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 15 (2021) is an entry-level gaming laptop that's available with AMD Ryzen 5000-series CPUs and dedicated NVIDIA GPUs. It's made entirely of plastic, yet it feels well built and solid. It's also very easy to access the internals if you need to upgrade the RAM or add a 2.5 inch hard drive. The user experience is decent overall: the keys on the keyboard are well spaced and have a good amount of travel, and there's a Numpad if you often do calculations or work in spreadsheets. Its touchpad tracks movements well, although it has some trouble with multi-touch gestures. There's a decent selection of ports, including a dedicated HDMI 2.0 port and three total USB ports to connect all your peripherals, but its single USB-C port only supports data transfer and video output, so you can't use it to charge the laptop. Unfortunately, the screen looks washed out due to its narrow color gamut, and it doesn't get bright enough for use outdoors or in bright rooms. Also, it has poor battery life and can't get through a full workday, and it gets noticeably hot and very loud under load. You'll likely need a dedicated microphone for video conferences as the built-in microphone records muffled, nasally audio.

        We tested the Pavilion Gaming Laptop with a 1080p 60Hz display, an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The Ryzen 5 5600H is more than enough for most modern AAA titles and heavy creative workloads, but you can get the more powerful Ryzen 7 5800H if you need more cores and threads for applications like physics simulations or video editing. If you want features like ray-tracing or DLSS upscaling in your games, we suggest you opt for the RTX 3050 or 3050Ti as the 1650 doesn't support either of them. Finally, you can upgrade to a 144Hz</p>
